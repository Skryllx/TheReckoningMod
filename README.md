#  The Reckoning - A Terraria Expansion Mod

**Every victory comes with sacrifice.**

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **The Reckoning**, an ambitious Terraria expansion mod that introduces a divine war between Order and Chaos ‚Äî complete with 26+ unique bosses, moral choices, evolving biomes, and a branching progression system shaped by the player‚Äôs decisions.

This mod reimagines Terraria not just as a sandbox game, but as a mythic narrative. Your actions don‚Äôt just affect what you can craft ‚Äî they determine the fate of the world.

##  Overview

The Reckoning is built around one central question:
> *What if power didn't make you a hero? What if it made you something worse?*

Players are drawn into a war between two ancient factions:
- **The Pantheon of Order** ‚Äì Builders of balance, enforcers of control.
- **The Agents of Chaos** ‚Äì Rebels against structure, seekers of boundless freedom.

You'll choose a side, and your progression will diverge based on that choice. Entire boss fights, weapons, armors, and even world features will shift depending on your path.
